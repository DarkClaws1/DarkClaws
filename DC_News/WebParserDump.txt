										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A crowd gathered at 45th &#038; 9th in New York City on Wednesday when they saw a carriage horse collapse in the street during rush hour. </p>
<p>What they saw next was heartbreaking. </p>
<p>The carriage driver was yelling &#8220;Get up! Get up!&#8221; as he smacked the horse with the reins to try and get him to stand up.   Kelvin Gonzalez and several other people intervened and told the man to stop hitting the horse and to offer him water. &#8220;I told him, ‚ÄòYo, stop whipping him, give him some water. That‚Äôs a horse, not a machine,‚Äô&#8221; Gonzalez <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/08/10/carriage-horse-passes-out-near-midtown-manhattan/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">told </a>The New York Post. </p>
<p>&#8220;It‚Äôs really sad, man. You can tell that horse was not taken care of. You can tell he was exploiting that horse. The horse was hungry, he was thirsty. You can tell the horse collapsed from the thirst.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Distressing video.</p>

<p>It was 87 degrees that day and the horse refused to get up, even with the driver yelling and pulling at him. He eventually rolled on his side and put his head on the hot asphalt.</p>
<p>NYPD was called to help. </p>
<p>Mounted officers arrived and doused the horse with ice and water to lower his body temperature. A pillow was placed under his head as he recovered. The horse was down on the hot pavement for over an hour before he was able to stand on his own.</p>

<p>He was loaded into a trailer and brought to a nearby stable where he was examined by a veterinarian.</p>
<p>According to the Transport Workers Union, who represents carriage drivers, the 14-year-old bay horse is named Ryder. They claim he collapsed from a neurological disease, EPM, caused from eating possum droppings.   </p>

<p>Ryder was seen eating hay in the stable and standing on his own. However, many people commented on how skinny and emaciated he was. </p>

<p>In a statement released by NYPD, they said, &#8220;The NYPD takes the health and well-being of our four-legged friends in New York City very seriously, and are glad that our trained equestrian officers were able to assist.&#8221; </p>
<p>The disturbing incident has even more people calling for an immediate ban on horse-drawn carriages in NYC. Animal advocates have been pushing for a ban for years. Proposed legislation, <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5725261&#038;GUID=08B70306-1523-4CCB-A8AB-1C506CB58635&#038;Options=ID|Text|&#038;Search=0573" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Intro 573</a>, would replace horse-drawn carriage with electric carriages. </p>
<p>NYCLASS tweeted, &#8220;The world is watching.&#8221; </p>
<p>Sign the petition below that calls for a ban on carriage horses in New York City. </p>

Each organization has done its best to ensure proper care and home for animals ‚Äî wild or domesticated.

Those organizations are also a safe haven for orphaned animals who were found alone ‚Äî with no idea how to fend for themselves. </p>

<p>A bobcat kitten in the Santa Cruz mountains was found and rescued by the <a href="https://www.nativeanimalrescue.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Native Animal Rescue</a> of Santa Cruz County. The baby bobcat was strolling the paths of the Bonny Doon area in California ‚Äî its parents were nowhere to be found. Due to its condition, the animal rescue took the kitten to the <a href="https://www.werc-ca.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wildlife Education and Rehabilitation Center</a> in Morgan Hill. Since the kitten was found in the Bonny Doon area, the wildlife staff named it ‚ÄúBonny.‚Äù It was a great thing that good-hearted people found Bonny. The kitten is now being nurtured in the facility ‚Äî where it is safe to grow and learn how to survive.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Adorable baby bobcat rescued in Santa Cruz mountains" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6N_97V7jzcg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Bonny is one of the wild animals being taken care of in the center ‚Äî most of which are orphans. ‚ÄúShe is acclimating to her new enclosure and has a healthy appetite,‚Äù WERC shared in an <a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/adorable-baby-bobcat-rescued-in-santa-cruz-mountains/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interview</a>. A video of Bonny was also shared by WERC, where she diligently groomed her face and paws. The orphans sheltered by WERC will be released to the wild after survival training and health checkups. Providing a better future for the baby animals has become their purpose ‚Äî dedicating their lives to finally seeing the animals back to their homes.</p>
<p>Engaging them with a staff dressed in a bobcat costume is part of giving them a temporary comfortable shelter. Colleen Grzan is a bobcat supervisor, and she suits up into her whole body costume with a mask every time she feeds and interacts with the kittens. Through this, bobcat kittens can still somehow engage with an adult bobcat. They must assure that the kittens under their care won‚Äôt fully adapt to the presence of humans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Animals tend to be snappy to humans when they find it hard to trust due to previous experiences. Baby animals who aren&#8217;t taught by parents about socializing grow to be hostile. They still don&#8217;t know how to move around the environment, making them skeptical of almost everything. People must be patient and alert during the rescue mission ‚Äî to avoid accidents for both rescuer and rescuee. Marcus Monaghan showed how to handle a hissing baby animal he rescued in Ireland.</p>

<p>During a trip, Marcus rescued an orphaned baby seal ‚Äî who was a very snappy creature. The baby seal was angry at Marcus even though he saved him. Nevertheless, Marcus still finds the baby seal adorable ‚Äî the rescuer just smiled and laughed every time the pup got snappy. Monaghan shared a video of the baby seal on his TikTok account, which amazingly gained 22.9 million views. In the video, Marcus showed how he took care of the baby seal despite the hissing he received. Three videos about the hissing baby seal were posted on Marcus‚Äôs TikTok account. The second video was about their ride to the rehabilitation center.</p>

<p>Since the seal is already an orphan, he needs to be taken care of by professionals. Marcus took the snappy baby to the <a href="https://www.sealrescueireland.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Seal Rescue</a> center in Wexford, Ireland. Melanie, the executive director, explained the pup‚Äôs condition, and it turned out he was underweight. ‚ÄúHe must have been orphaned before his mother taught him how to eat, so he was unable to hunt, he was unable to feed on his own,‚Äù Melanie shared. The team named the baby seal Phoenix and engaged him in all sorts of training. Phoenix was introduced to a ‚Äúfish school‚Äù to learn how to eat. His training involved a bathtub where he was given fish to eat ‚Äî he was a bad eater during the first sessions.</p>
<figure id="attachment_386891" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-386891" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/hissing-baby-seal-in-line-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="523" class="size-full wp-image-386891" data-srcset="https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/hissing-baby-seal-in-line-2.jpg 1000w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/hissing-baby-seal-in-line-2-600x314.jpg 600w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/hissing-baby-seal-in-line-2-300x157.jpg 300w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/hissing-baby-seal-in-line-2-768x402.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(min-width:1200px) 1200px, (min-width:992px) 992px, (min-width:768px) 768px, (min-width:576px) 480px, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-386891" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Youtube/The Dodo</figcaption></figure>
<p>‚ÄúEventually, he did get the hang of things. He was moved out to the pools,‚Äù Melanie explained. ‚ÄúHe was able to compete against other seals and learn from their behaviors a bit,‚Äù she continued. Phoenix was able to show improvements after a few months ‚Äî the once snapping seal was nurtured well and is now able to socialize. For this reason, the rehabilitation knew it was the right time to release Phoenix to his beloved home. It was a great thing that Marcus found the poor baby seal in the wild and brought him to rehab, where he was able to improve Phoenix. The baby seal was ready to face the wild with everything he had learned in the center.</p>
<p>The team sent Phoenix and Proxima, another baby seal, to the wild like the first day of school. Both seals seemed to be hesitant at first, but Phoenix put on a brave act ‚Äî he took the first step to experience his natural home. With Phoenix&#8217;s bravery, Proxima got motivated to step outside her cage. They are now finally home and free to lead their own lives. It was a proud moment; you can watch it in the video below. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rescue dogs often have trouble interacting with their surroundings due to trauma and prefer to be left alone or stay in a spot where they feel most comfortable. Shelters, foster homes, and adoptive parents have the responsibility to help those dogs overcome anxiety and fear. Part of taking care of them is to be aware of their triggers. The world&#8217;s beauty must be shown to those dogs ‚Äî to enjoy their new life.</p>

<p>A stray pit bull was found by the dumpster, and she is currently staying with her foster mom, Laura. Thankfully, the female pit bull was a gentle canine, and she allowed Laura to approach her. The foster mom carefully put a leash on the dog, but it was having difficulties walking. Apparently, the female canine was frozen on the spot due to fear. Laura had no choice but to pick her up and carry her inside the car. </p>
<figure id="attachment_386885" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-386885" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pit-bull-mcdonalds-in-line-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1000" class="size-full wp-image-386885" data-srcset="https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pit-bull-mcdonalds-in-line-2.jpg 1000w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pit-bull-mcdonalds-in-line-2-338x338.jpg 338w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pit-bull-mcdonalds-in-line-2-675x675.jpg 675w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pit-bull-mcdonalds-in-line-2-169x169.jpg 169w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pit-bull-mcdonalds-in-line-2-768x768.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(min-width:1200px) 1200px, (min-width:992px) 992px, (min-width:768px) 768px, (min-width:576px) 480px, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-386885" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Youtube/The Dodo</figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8220;Once we got home, she wouldn&#8217;t move for nothing. Her fear was so deep that she wouldn&#8217;t move, even when she needed to go potty,&#8221; Laura explained. She had to carry the poor Cocoa Bean like a baby for about two weeks. Due to Cocoa&#8217;s state, Laura was determined to help the anxious dog eliminate her fears and be confident again. Out of love and care, Laura would take Cocoa Bean for car rides ‚Äî to show the dog the fun of going on a trip. Part of their itinerary is the McDonald&#8217;s Drive Thru.</p>
<p>The foster mom treated Cocoa Bean as if her child and Mcdonald&#8217;s were the cure for sadness. Laura would order a cheeseburger without the condiments and cheese ‚Äî Cocoa Bean would happily eat her bread and patty. Interestingly, the method was effective ‚Äî Mcdonald&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t just a happy meal for humans. Cocoa Bean loved their car rides in the drive-thru which eventually made her feel safe during the trip. It took ten rides before Cocoa got over her fear of car rides. The confidence was evident as soon as she stopped shaking every time she sat on the passenger seat. Laura successfully gave her adorable pit bull something to look forward to every day.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I finally saw Cocoa Bean opening up and being so happy, jumping in the car, it just made me happy too, and I share a hamburger with her, and we&#8217;re both happy in the car,&#8221; says Laura. Cocoa Bean has started to grow out of her shell ‚Äî one of the things that made her happy was the day Laura took her to the state park. Laura sees how Cocoa&#8217;s personality has changed since she fostered the pit bull. The last thing that Laura wanted for Cocoa Bean was to find her a loving home.</p>
<p>Cocoa Bean is currently available for adoption from the Houston City of Strays. Laura is now searching for a family that will love and cherish her little Cocoa Bean until old age. You can learn more about the shelter by visiting their <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@houstoncityofstrays" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TikTok</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/houstoncityofstrays/?hl=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/houstoncityofstrays/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Facebook</a> pages. Aside from Cocoa, other dogs are waiting for a warm home, and surely, one of them might be the one you are looking for as a family member.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cats getting stuck on the tree have become one of the news that people often see on news outlets. Those felines get excited with their little adventures ‚Äî climbing high trees, making it difficult to go down even for an agile and flexible creature. They are usually rescued by concerned citizens or with the help of a fire brigade. However, in Auckland, the cat climbed up a tree that was too high for the fire brigade. For this reason, Esca stayed on the tree at <a href="https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/parks-recreation/get-outdoors/find-a-walk/Pages/tahuna-torea.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tahuna Torea</a> reserve for four days.</p>

<!-- Shortcode does not match the conditions -->
<p>According to <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/129152075/boy-11-rescues-cat-in-tree-that-was-too-high-for-fire-brigade" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Carmen Brown</a>, Esca‚Äôs pet parent, she initially called the St. Heliers fire brigade. Unfortunately, the team doesn‚Äôt have an available ladder ‚Äî long enough to reach the 15-meter tree. The only ladder in possession of the unit was just 10.5 meters. They advised Carmen to just wait for Esca to go down voluntarily. Carmen was willing to try anything and even asked for an <a href="https://www.treesaregood.org/treeowner/whyhireanarborist" rel="noopener" target="_blank">arborist</a>. However, some things need to be processed by the Auckland Council. They need to ask for a permit first before the arborist can scale a tree from a reserve.</p>
<p>After consulting with different agencies, Carmen went and informed the local community through their page. She asked them to look out for Esca in case the cat was able to climb down. Thankfully, the news reached the family of a young hero from their community. Andrea and her son Daniel Penman decided to help Carmen with her problem. Apparently, Daniel was a talented tree climber. Andrea even called him part monkey due to his incredible climbing skills.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-cat-on-a-tree-11209055/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><figure id="attachment_386876" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-386876" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/boy-cat-in-line-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1000" class="size-full wp-image-386876" data-srcset="https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/boy-cat-in-line-2.jpg 1000w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/boy-cat-in-line-2-338x338.jpg 338w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/boy-cat-in-line-2-675x675.jpg 675w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/boy-cat-in-line-2-169x169.jpg 169w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/boy-cat-in-line-2-768x768.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(min-width:1200px) 1200px, (min-width:992px) 992px, (min-width:768px) 768px, (min-width:576px) 480px, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-386876" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Pexels/Muhtelif</figcaption></figure></a></p>
<p>Daniel‚Äôs mother trusts him even though some parents get worried for the child‚Äôs safety. The 11-year-old boy amazingly climbed up the tree and successfully saved Esca with the help of cat biscuits. He carried the cat by placing it inside a drawstring backpack ‚Äî for a safe landing. The intelligent young boy applied his knowledge of creating knots to create a harness of rope for himself. </p>
<p>‚ÄúI was horrified when I saw how high Daniel climbed up the tree. I told my husband to take whatever cash we had in our wallets to give him, and it turned out to be $40,‚Äù Carmen said. Thanks to Daniel, Esca was safely brought to the ground without any harm. Esca is now home with Carmen and his cat siblings ‚Äî already well fed and provided with water. Heroes come at different ages; sometimes, he‚Äôs an 11-year-old boy with excellent climbing skills. Daniel‚Äôs efforts are well-appreciated and won‚Äôt be forgotten by the community.   </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three young boys from New Jersey were exploring a forest on their bikes when they accidentally got lost and were missing for several hours.</p>
<p>The whole neighborhood, including departments from two counties, banded together to look for the missing boys, but it was a police K-9 who ended up being the hero.</p>
<figure id="attachment_386866" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-386866" style="width: 1119px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-11-at-6.42.54-PM-1119x675.png" alt="" width="1119" height="675" class="size-large wp-image-386866" data-srcset="https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-11-at-6.42.54-PM-1119x675.png 1119w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-11-at-6.42.54-PM-560x338.png 560w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-11-at-6.42.54-PM-280x169.png 280w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-11-at-6.42.54-PM-768x463.png 768w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-11-at-6.42.54-PM.png 1290w" data-sizes="(min-width:1200px) 1200px, (min-width:992px) 992px, (min-width:768px) 768px, (min-width:576px) 480px, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-386866" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjnQx8_eLwM">YouTube/CBS Philly</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The K-9, a Bloodhound named Shiloh with the Gloucester County Sheriff‚Äôs Department, was able to track the boys&#8217; scents and lead police to them.</p>
<p>In order for Shiloh to track their scent, officers used the boys&#8217; bed sheets to help Shiloh know what they smell like.</p>
<p>After walking, they ended up at a creek. Along the way, Shiloh found the boys&#8217; shoes and led police through the creek for a mile until they finally found the boys.</p>

<p>Thankfully, none of them were injured. They told police that they were searching YouTube for videos on how to survive in the wild while they were lost.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s safe to say that the boys won&#8217;t be doing any more exploring any time soon!</p>

<p>The Gloucester County Sheriff‚Äôs Department has used bloodhounds since 2013 and has trained them to search for kids and older adults who suffer from Alzheimer&#8217;s or dementia and often wander off. </p>
<p>The dogs are given an article of clothing or something else with the missing person&#8217;s scent on it, and the dog is then trained to track that specific scent to find them.</p>

<p>Someone had abandoned a dog at a lonely stretch of road near my home, and four lovely puppies were born a week later. Three were brownies and one a mix of black and white. The puppies were housed inside a roadside scupper and the mother dog would show her displeasure when someone went near. If it rained, I worried the puppies would be washed away, if not drowned.</p>

<p>A friend posted photographs of the puppies on the internet and within a week, all the puppies were adopted but not the mother dog. I named her Ah Girl. Ah Girl was lonely and hungry because she could not find food, so I fed her twice daily. She would wait for my arrival at the T-junction where I would give her meals. Each time I left, she would attempt to prevent me from leaving.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, I saw that she was wounded. I thought in time, it would heal. Instead, it got worse. So I took her home and gave her medical treatment. After the wound healed, she was spayed to join the rest of my dogs. My wife and I agreed that this would be our last addition. We already had six adult dogs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Humans have a natural tendency to pet a dog whenever they see one, even if the dog isn&#8217;t real. While you should always ask permission to pet someone&#8217;s dog, people are taking a moment to honor the dog monuments around the world with a pat on the nose or back. </p>
<p>Hero dogs like Balto and faithful companions like Fala, Hachiko, and many more are still receiving love long after they have passed away.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FNationalMallNPS%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0M9DWBysxW1e2p5TES742rzLX5fgZajWjTW8rMtNLuD4P32GLexFBhKQdDxhmY2dVl&#038;show_text=true&#038;width=500" width="500" height="705" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe></p>
<p>It is obvious where people are petting the bronze statues because that area is turning gold. The natural oxidization process turns the statue a dark color, but the regular rubbing removes that and gives it a gold glow. </p>
<p>Take a look at the bronzed hero Balto who lives in Central Park, New York. The husky led a sled team through a blizzard to bring medicine to sick individuals in Alaska. &#8220;Back in 1925 Nome, Alaska was stricken with a horrific diphtheria outbreak. Not enough antitoxin was available to treat all the sick until teams of mushers and sled dogs battled a blinding blizzard and traveled 674 miles to deliver the medicine,&#8221; <a href="https://www.centralpark.com/things-to-do/attractions/balto/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shared</a> Central Park. </p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcentralpark%2Fphotos%2Fa.487597507957018%2F1719830058067084%2F%3Ftype%3D3&#038;show_text=false&#038;width=500" width="500" height="498" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe></p>
<p>The same year, sculptor Frederick George Richard Roth was commissioned to create a statue of the brave dog who attended the reveal. Today the statue is a popular place for photos where children sit on his back or give him a pat for being such a good boy. </p>
<p>Scotland&#8217;s most famous dog, a Skye Terrier named Bobby, is also one of the most loyal dogs to have ever lived. When his owner, John Gray, passed away the faithful dog went and sat at his grave every day for 14 years. Shortly before Bobby passed away, a statue was built in his honor on top of a fountain. </p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fplaybilltravel%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02c3wXmUyHuAS9YEb49ay1M7wS2d45aRpw4nxaLS67M2yLnDPMA7HEjpJVyzH1U2yfl&#038;show_text=false&#038;width=500" width="500" height="498" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe></p>
<p>He was buried near his dad but his story lives on. His nose is shiny because people believe touching it will bring them luck. However, the City of Edinburgh has asked people to refrain from touching it to preserve the statue. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the things we wish for when we have a pet dog is spending many happy years together. </p>
<p>Playing, taking walks in the park, watching movies, preparing dinner for everyone, talking to your dog while it responds with barks, hugging it with sweetness, and your dog licking you with happiness.</p>

<p>Yes, it can be regretful that dogs do not live as long as humans. But, when adopting a dog, you can make a choice among <a href="https://www.rdasia.com/food-hohttps://www.rdasia.com/food-home-garden/pets/10-of-the-healthiest-dog-breeds?utm_source=Resp&amp;utm_medium=Emailing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dog breeds with a longer, healthier lifespan</a>. </p>
<p>Want to find out which dog breeds they are, here&#8217;s a list of them:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/australian-cattle-dog/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Australian Cattle Dog</a>. This dog breed holds the record for the oldest dog to have ever lived at 29 years old based on the Guinness Book of World Records. Also called Blue Heeler or Queensland Heeler, this high-spirited dog breed is known for smartness, mental keenness, strength, and agility. ,‚ÄúThese dogs live so long because they are naturally active, which means they get a lot of health benefits from exercise,‚Äù <a href="https://www.rdasia.com/food-hohttps://www.rdasia.com/food-home-garden/pets/10-of-the-healthiest-dog-breeds?utm_source=Resp&amp;utm_medium=Emailing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a> Jeff Neal of The Critter Depot. ‚ÄúBut they are also a small to medium-sized dog, which means they don‚Äôt have a lot of weight to lumber around that breaks down their cartilage faster.‚Äù</li>
