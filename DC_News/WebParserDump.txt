										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Losing an ability is absolutely terrifying — you&#8217;ll never know if you&#8217;ll learn to do it again. It&#8217;s scarier if it&#8217;s the ability to move a part of your body that is essential to your daily life. One of the most terrifying conditions would be leg paralysis. Not being able to walk can negatively impact someone — especially their mental health. This will raise a lot of questions, and it can make someone feel inadequate.</p>
<figure id="attachment_389686" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-389686" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rooster-walk-in-line-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1000" class="size-full wp-image-389686" data-srcset="https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rooster-walk-in-line-1.jpg 1000w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rooster-walk-in-line-1-338x338.jpg 338w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rooster-walk-in-line-1-675x675.jpg 675w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rooster-walk-in-line-1-169x169.jpg 169w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rooster-walk-in-line-1-768x768.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(min-width:1200px) 1200px, (min-width:992px) 992px, (min-width:768px) 768px, (min-width:576px) 480px, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-389686" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Youtube/The Dodo</figcaption></figure>
<p>For this reason, a support system is vital during the recovery stage. You&#8217;ll need people who will encourage and aid you in overcoming negative thoughts that can hugely affect the healing process. Sadly, even animals can experience leg paralysis. Lucky for this rooster, he has someone who supported him throughout his recovery. Napoleon is a rooster from the Alpaca Treehouse in Atlanta — which is being managed by his human friend, Kara.</p>
<p>&#8220;Napoleon landed in a terrible situation. He was hung upside down, and he lost movement in both of his legs,&#8221; Kara explained. &#8220;At first, he was just a feathered lump in a towel donut. Neither leg was functioning at all.&#8221; They had to consult a vet to further understand Napoleon&#8217;s condition. According to the vet, Napoleon&#8217;s legs weren&#8217;t entirely numb, which sparked hope for Kara. From day one, the Alpaca Treehouse owner ensured that Napoleon was given extra care. She became the rooster&#8217;s companion — which was extremely helpful for him.</p>

<p>After a week, Napoleon just stayed in one place but slowly returned to his livelier self. Kara took it as a good sign of recovery then they started with physical therapy. Napoleon was so cooperative during each therapy session — his determination was apparent. Seeing him gradually learn how to walk again without any fuss was wonderful. He was listening to everything the therapist instructed him to do.</p>
<figure id="attachment_389688" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-389688" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rooster-walk-in-line-3.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1000" class="size-full wp-image-389688" data-srcset="https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rooster-walk-in-line-3.jpg 1000w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rooster-walk-in-line-3-338x338.jpg 338w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rooster-walk-in-line-3-675x675.jpg 675w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rooster-walk-in-line-3-169x169.jpg 169w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rooster-walk-in-line-3-768x768.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(min-width:1200px) 1200px, (min-width:992px) 992px, (min-width:768px) 768px, (min-width:576px) 480px, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-389688" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Youtube/The Dodo</figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8220;We would do these mini sessions a couple times a day. I had no idea what the outcome would be, but we never gave up on him, and he never gave up on himself,&#8221; Kara said. Due to consistent therapy and Napoleon&#8217;s perseverance, he was able to stand up on his own one day. It was a win for him and Kara — their hope became more vibrant. Eventually, the mighty rooster was able to join his friends back in the coop. He showed tremendous improvement every day. To be accompanied by a great person like Kara and being a strong-willed rooster, there is no doubt that walking again is possible.</p>
<p>Napoleon went from standing up with his legs to running around the coop again. His story is one for the books which can serve as an inspiration to anyone feeling hopeless at the moment. The Alpaca Treehouse was the right place for Napoleon, where he had a successful healing process. You can visit and learn more about their place by following them on their socials.

Thousands of what-ifs will run in your mind, but you must overcome those thoughts. Simply prepare for the date like the golden retriever winning people&#8217;s hearts on the internet. You might learn something from Sammy&#8217;s Instagram reel — he prepared for a date in the most relaxed demeanor. Apparently, the handsome goldie was getting ready for his date with Layla. The clip showed Sammy&#8217;s &#8220;get ready with me&#8221; video which started with him taking a bath.</p>

<p>Some people also asked for an update of the date in the comment section. However, there&#8217;s still no news from both sides but here&#8217;s to hoping they had a great time during the date. For now, you can get to know more about Sammy and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/laylatheegolden/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Layla</a> by following their respective Instagram pages. Besides the get ready with me video, Sammy has many endearing contents that will make you fall for him even more. And if you find yourself struggling while preparing for a date, watch Sammy&#8217;s Instagram reel to lighten up — be reminded to stay calm, bring a flower, and wear your best smile.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having the lifestyle of a pet parent is a choice. People are often driven by their love for animals and adopt a pet or two. Those people are the ones who have been taking care of animals since they were kids. Their love for animals knows no bounds — being a pet parent has been their calling. It’s lovely that pet parents chose a road to provide hope for animals — giving them the life they deserve.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/woman-in-sweater-holding-orange-and-white-cat-6865039/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><figure id="attachment_389661" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-389661" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="523" class="size-full wp-image-389661" data-srcset="https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-1.jpg 1000w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-1-600x314.jpg 600w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-1-300x157.jpg 300w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-1-768x402.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(min-width:1200px) 1200px, (min-width:992px) 992px, (min-width:768px) 768px, (min-width:576px) 480px, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-389661" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Pexels/cottonbro</figcaption></figure></a></p>
<p>But sometimes, a person can unexpectedly turn into a pet parent. They spent time planning the future, and pet adoption did not even cross their mind. Life just amazingly led them to someone — an animal that will bring positive changes with love. They did not choose the pet parenting life; it chose them. Interestingly, Cindy had a similar experience that she shared with GeoBeats Animals. Her life went completely different when she suddenly became a full-time pet mom. More surprisingly, it wasn’t a cat or dog; she found a squirrel.</p>
<figure id="attachment_389662" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-389662" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1000" class="size-full wp-image-389662" data-srcset="https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-2.jpg 1000w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-2-338x338.jpg 338w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-2-675x675.jpg 675w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-2-169x169.jpg 169w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-2-768x768.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(min-width:1200px) 1200px, (min-width:992px) 992px, (min-width:768px) 768px, (min-width:576px) 480px, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-389662" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Youtube/GeoBeats Animals</figcaption></figure>
<p>“One evening, my boyfriend and I were driving home, and we saw something on the road. It was a baby squirrel, and she was wet,” Cindy narrated. “It was pretty late in the day, and it was chilly outside. So I took Sammy home.” Since then, her pet parenting journey began. Although Cindy had no idea about caring for a baby squirrel, she did her best through research. The baby squirrel she named Sammy just found a warm home — meeting Cindy was serendipitous. </p>
<figure id="attachment_389663" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-389663" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-3.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1000" class="size-full wp-image-389663" data-srcset="https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-3.jpg 1000w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-3-338x338.jpg 338w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-3-675x675.jpg 675w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-3-169x169.jpg 169w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-3-768x768.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(min-width:1200px) 1200px, (min-width:992px) 992px, (min-width:768px) 768px, (min-width:576px) 480px, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-389663" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Youtube/GeoBeats Animals</figcaption></figure>
<p>It has been three years since Cindy found Sammy. She’s completely happy and healthy due to Cindy’s excellent nurturing skills. And it wasn’t just Sammy who got to experience Cindy’s love. Barkley, a male squirrel, entered their lives. “A girl on Instagram actually sent me a message about him. She has found this young male squirrel and needed to find somebody that could take him,” Cindy shared. Without thinking twice, the squirrel mom brought in a friend for Sammy. However, the two squirrels didn’t get along first until after a couple of months. Cindy&#8217;s adorable squirrels are now the best of friends.</p>
<figure id="attachment_389664" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-389664" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-4.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1000" class="size-full wp-image-389664" data-srcset="https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-4.jpg 1000w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-4-338x338.jpg 338w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-4-675x675.jpg 675w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-4-169x169.jpg 169w, https://d1dd4ethwnlwo2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/woman-squirrel-in-line-4-768x768.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(min-width:1200px) 1200px, (min-width:992px) 992px, (min-width:768px) 768px, (min-width:576px) 480px, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-389664" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Youtube/GeoBeats Animals</figcaption></figure>
<p>Cindy devoted her time to creating a safe space and warm home for the two squirrels. When she became a squirrel mom, vacations rarely happen for her. Her house turned into a loving nest for her adorable squirrels — specifically the living room. It’s excellent that Sammy and Barkley became close, and Cindy could leave the house without the two causing any trouble.</p>
<p>She even shared that Barkley is a lot closer to Sammy. Cindy believes that maybe it’s because Barkley didn’t grow up with her since he was a baby. Still, they have this parent-child bond that Cindy wouldn’t trade for the world. She considers herself lucky for having Sammy and Barkley in her life. The two squirrels filled her life with light and love. It’s evident that their bond is unbreakable; you can witness that in the video below. You can even follow them on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sammygirl_and_barkleysquirrel/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Instagram</a>. You’ll get to see the life of a full-time pet parent — it’s terrific even without getting a vacation.</p>

<p>We found Honey the evening of this past 4th of July. Her eyes were completely sealed closed and she was running around blind afraid of the fireworks.</p>

<p>We called the SPCA for her. When they came, they immediately told us she would be put to sleep because she was too small. Of course we brought her right home and made a room for her. The doctors a few days later told us she was 0.5 pounds, would lose both of her eyes due to infection, and possibly wouldn&#8217;t pull through at all.</p>
<p>Here we are a few months later and not only did little Honey pull through, but somehow through hard work, she kept both of her eyes and can see just fine! We had planned on rehoming her when she got big enough but now we realize we can&#8217;t! She&#8217;s part of the family.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know that mice love cheese. It&#8217;s a stereotype for a reason. </p>
<p>For those who have mice hiding in their homes, you&#8217;d think the first thing they&#8217;d want to do is hide the cheese (and other snacks) to deter the mice from eating, but a woman named Bella had other plans. </p>

<p>Bella (TikTok user <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jorgeregula222" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@jorgeregula222</a>) went viral for deciding to shower her uninvited mouse guest with kindness.</p>
<p>In a video uploaded to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jorgeregula222/video/7136583841518505259" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TikTok</a>, Bella explained that she discovered a mouse was living in her wall and he kept eating her food. </p>

<p>While most people would try to get rid of the mouse with an exterminator or trap, Bella had other plans. Instead of hiding her food away and getting rid of the mouse, she decided to treat him to a proper meal! </p>
<p>She captioned the post, &#8220;he kept eating our food so we decided to do him one better.&#8221; </p>

<p>She created a tiny cheese board fit for a mouse that featured champagne BellaVitano, smoked gouda, provolone, raspberry BellaVitano, crackers, honey, pomegranate chocolate, walnuts, pear paste, and a raspberry. </p>
<p>The sweet meal was even complete with a glass of water and a tiny bouquet of wildflowers. </p>

<p>Bella ended up naming the mouse Honey and she continued to make new meals for him! </p>
<p>In follow-up clips, she offered him a tiny peanut butter and jelly sandwich along with a bowl of spaghetti. She even built him his own tiny house so he&#8217;d have a proper dining room table. </p>

<p>A video captured one of the times the three dogs rode the spiral slide to the bottom. But first, they had to take an elevator up to the top. </p>

<p>Growing up, I had a lot of great toys and things to play with. My family had a lovely backyard with trees to climb, a garden to tend, tetherball and croquet for fun, and plenty of space to run and play. </p>
<p>One thing I always wanted, however, was a spiral slide to play on. Parks had slides and they were so much fun, I hoped to have one in my own yard. But alas, my parents never put one in. </p>

<p>A group of dogs is living out my childhood dreams, though, with their very own spiral slide! Their owner built the slide into their dog house and it&#8217;s complete with an elevator. </p>
<p>Some people might not think dogs would enjoy going down a slide, but these three pups seem to absolutely love it!</p>

<p>As you can see in the video below, they happily hop in the elevator and ride up to the top of their slide. Then, one by one they jump down the tube and enjoy the ride. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s so cute! Check out the video below:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain&#8217;s Queen Elizabeth II, who recently marked 70 years on the throne, has died. She was 96. </p>
<p>Buckingham Palace made the announcement Thursday, saying that the Queen had passed away at Balmoral Castle in Scotland that afternoon. This came after an announcement earlier in the day saying she was under medical supervision due to her doctors&#8217; concern for her health. Her children and grandchildren were reportedly in Scotland with the monarch, with the palace saying that the new King and Queen Consort would remain on hand that night and leave for London in the morning. </p>

<p>The Queen&#8217;s death comes after she had stepped back from many events in recent months due to mobility issues. She had also lost her husband of 73 years, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, last year.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth II was born April 21, 1926 in London to Prince Albert, Duke of York, and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. Her father was the second son of the reigning king, George V, but when his older brother, Edward VIII, abdicated in 1936, the young princess became heir to the throne.</p>
<p>She began her life of service to her country at a young age, <a href="https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/queen-elizabeth-ii-during-world-war-ii">serving in</a> the Auxiliary Territorial Service of the British Army during World War II. Joining at 18, she worked as a mechanic. Earlier on in the war, at the age of 14, she had also shared an encouraging message that was broadcast over radio to other children who had been evacuated away from their families for safety.</p>
<p>She ascended to the throne on February 6, 1952, upon the death of her father, King George VI. She was 25 at the time, and a mother to two young children. Her coronation was held the following June. In June 2022, her Platinum Jubilee, marking 70 years on the throne, was celebrated across the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Throughout those 70 years, she oversaw 15 prime ministers, dating back to Winston Churchill. She appointed the latest, Liz Truss, just days before her death. She also visited every country within the Commonwealth at least once and regularly engaged with her public, racking up more than 21,000 engagements throughout her reign. Her Christmas messages were a constant, as well, with the Queen delivering a message in all but one year since she took the throne.</p>
<p>Her reign also set a record when she surpassed Queen Victoria&#8217;s total tenure in September 2015, making her the longest serving monarch in British history.</p>

<p>Apart from her official duties, she was known for being an avid horsewoman and a huge fan of corgis. When her first corgi, Susan, died in 1959, the Queen made sure <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61606972">a tombstone honored</a> her furry friend. After that, she owned more than 30 additional corgis. She made sure to walk them every day, until her mobility issues got in the way. </p>
<p>The Queen leaves behind four children, eight grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.</p>
<p>Her oldest child, the newly named King Charles III, released a statement on her passing, saying, &#8220;The death of my beloved Mother, Her Majesty The Queen, is a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family.</p>
<p>&#8220;We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished Sovereign and a much-loved Mother. I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;During this period of mourning and change, my family and I will be comforted and sustained by our knowledge of the respect and deep affection in which The Queen was so widely held.&#8221;</p>

<p>So what comes next? The protocol is contained in &#8220;Operation London Bridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>When a monarch dies, a code has often been used to communicate the fact. In Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s case, that code was &#8220;London Bridge is down.&#8221; Once that code was relayed to the prime minister, the news was shared with the governments of the Commonwealth nations and the nations outside the UK for which the Queen serves as head of state. After that, the public learned the news.</p>
<p>That was accomplished in two primary ways: A footman dressed in black pinned the death announcement to Buckingham Palace&#8217;s gates, and a news alert was sent to global media simultaneously. The palace also communicated the message on its website, which reverted to a single page with a dark background.</p>
<p>With flags lowered to honor the Queen on the day of her death, they will be raised the next morning. At that time, Charles III will officially be named King and his wife Camilla will officially become Queen Consort. The new monarch will then embark on a tour of the UK.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Queen will lie in state at Westminster Hall ahead of her funeral, which will be held on the 10th day after her death. This occasion will be marked with a national day of mourning. She will be buried in St. George&#8217;s Chapel at Windsor Castle in the King George VI Memorial Chapel, with her parents, sister Princess Margaret, and husband Prince Philip.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As it is commonly said, dogs make our lives whole, so it makes sense that we feel lost and empty after they cross the Rainbow Bridge. No matter how many years we have with our furry friends saying goodbye is one of the hardest things to do. </p>
<p>Serena Williams, one of the greatest women&#8217;s tennis players of all time, shared on Instagram that her beloved dog, Lauerlei Linkogle Williams, passed away on Saturday. The little dog has been by her side for the past 18 years and Williams <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ChxOWsgrHvr/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrote</a>, &#8220;Lauerlei sadly took her last breath yesterday. I am sad but happy for all the time and all the extra I got to spend with her. She lived a long long life.&#8221;</p>

<p>The post was accompanied with several photos of Lauerlei that showed she was a cherished family member and will be missed by her humans and canine sibling, Chip. The Yorkshire terrier is comforting Williams and even joined her on the sidelines of the practice court at the U.S. Open. </p>
<p>Friends and fans sent their condolences and many fondly remembered meeting the pup and being bit by her. The feisty girl will not be forgotten. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bunnies and hens have gone together since ancient times, at least in the stories. Easter is known to feature bunnies with eggs, and some cultures even celebrate the two animals together. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/hares-and-chickens-were-godsnot-food-ancient-britain-180974663/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Smithsonian Magazine</a>, ancient Brits actually revered rabbits and bunnies as gods (long before Easter celebrations). </p>

<p>While it&#8217;s usually just in Easter stories and history lessons, bunnies and hens can go together in real life too. Just take the mama hen and little bunny living in Anserma, Colombia for example!   </p>
<p>According to <a href="https://citywildlife.org/found-animal/baby-rabbit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">City Wild Life</a>, rabbits stay with their mom in the nest for the first 15-20 days of life. </p>

<p>Before then, they need food and warmth to survive. </p>
<p>It seems a sweet mama hen recognized a little bunny was in need of some help and decided to step up to the job. </p>
<p>The mama hen carefully took the baby rabbit under her wing &#8211; literally &#8211; and kept it warm from the cool air at their farm. </p>

<p>Ramsey works in the healthcare field as a physician assistant. She&#8217;s driven to help people, and is passionate about doing the same for animals.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had unlimited funds and could do anything with my life, I would want nothing more than to open an animal sanctuary and save as many animals as I could,&#8221; she says. &#8220;That would be my dream life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would save all the dogs in the world, too,&#8221; Ramsey says. &#8220;But cats are easier and right now I don&#8217;t currently have space for a bunch of dogs in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had walked all around the outside, looked at all the kennels and there just wasn&#8217;t one that I felt a connection with. I walked around for a second time and it still didn&#8217;t happen,&#8221; she says. </p>
<p>Back inside, Ramsey found a litter of 10 puppies that had just been dropped off after being abandoned on the side of the road. </p>

<p>&#8220;They looked like lab puppies and we always had labs when I was growing up,&#8221; Ramsey says. &#8220;There was one little yellow one. I had a yellow lab growing up who lived to be 17 years old.</p>
<p>&#8220;The guy came in to ask if we needed anything and I asked him if I could just hold the yellow puppy and I never put him down,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;He went home with me that day&#8221;</p>

<p>Ramsey says her experience with Denver has put a lot in perspective, now that a new puppy has been added to the family.</p>
<p>&#8220;Denver now has a sister, and I&#8217;m realizing what a real puppy is like,&#8221; she says. &#8220;He&#8217;s been the best dog. He&#8217;s never as much as chewed a sock. He has been the best dog in the world. And he now has a 6-month-old little mixed breed sister Eden. Eden is teaching me what raising a typical puppy is like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though Eden needs a little more socialization training, Denver doesn&#8217;t play rough with the cats, at all. Ramsey says she can put a kitten right down in front of Denver. He will sniff it and walk away, or just lay there.</p>
<p>&#8220;They love Denver,&#8221; she says. &#8220;They love, love, love Denver. They do not love Eden, yet. Eden has wanted to chase the cats to play with them, but is learning that the cats don&#8217;t enjoy being chased.&#8221;</p>
<p>Denver and Eden currently live in a home with 20 cats, each once an animal that needed a home, which Ramsey has been grateful to give them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see an animal that needs a home — I see an animal that that needs shelter and needs food — It needs love and needs a good life and I can give it to them,&#8221; Ramsey says.</p>
<p>Ramsey says it&#8217;s often easier to bring in a kitten as opposed to an older cat, as they&#8217;re much easier to integrate into the pack. Otherwise, pets tend to get more territorial as they get older, and may not fit well in a home with other animals.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most of these cats come from living on the street,&#8221; Ramsey says. &#8220;When you have an adult cat who&#8217;s lived on the street and has had to fend against other cats for an area or territory or even fight for food, they aren&#8217;t always very friendly to other cats. Sometimes, unfortunately, those are cats that do better in only-cat homes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ramsey recalls one time when she had to return a cat after a month. Even separating the cat from the others in her home with child-proof gates wasn&#8217;t enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave it a good month and did everything I could do to introduce them,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I finally just had to accept that I think this is a cat that needs to be in a home by herself. I cried a little and it broke my heart, but I think it was the the best thing for her and for my cats.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though this goodbye was tearful, the cat was eventually adopted and went to a good home, and that&#8217;s the best outcome Ramsey could hope for.</p>
<p>This compassionate pet parent offers some great insight on her experiences with adopting and fostering cats. </p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to adopt a pet, you have to realize that this is a lifelong commitment,&#8221; she says. &#8220;These are animals that are going to be in your life for 15+ years. You have to be prepared for that. It&#8217;s a lifestyle change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As much as I love dogs, I can&#8217;t just pack up and leave for the weekend without making arrangements, to take them with me or have somebody to watch them,&#8221; she continues. &#8220;With cats I can go out of town for a night or two and the cats will be okay. But dogs can&#8217;t do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caring for a pet is a &#8220;huge responsibility&#8221; that requires preparation, Ramsey says. </p>
<p>&#8220;They are also not cheap and there will be times that they do tear the screen out of your back door or eat through your hammock or dig in your flower bed and bark nonstop at a neighbor dog,&#8221; she says. &#8220;There are times that you may want to pull your hair out. But that&#8217;s just part of it. When you accept that animal and you accept that responsibility, it&#8217;s up to you to train that animal. They don&#8217;t come trained. You have to train them and you have to teach them how to behave.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ramsey says she recently learned that for every homeless animal in the world to have a home, each person on earth would need to rescue 7.5 animals. </p>
<p>&#8220;So, I&#8217;ve done three people&#8217;s work,&#8221; she laughs.</p>

<p>The reality is, this work isn&#8217;t always easy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see a poor animal who&#8217;s in a bad situation and it literally breaks my heart,&#8221; Ramsey says. &#8220;Animals aren&#8217;t sick or injured because of something they&#8217;ve done wrong. They don&#8217;t have entitlement, they don&#8217;t have expectations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thankfully, these pets have found a caring owner and a loving home.</p>

<p>Within her pet family, Ramsey is currently fostering four little kittens who will one day be sent to new homes. She says she&#8217;s &#8220;been in tears already three or four times over the past week,&#8221; thinking about putting them up for adoption.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so rewarding,&#8221; she says.</p>
