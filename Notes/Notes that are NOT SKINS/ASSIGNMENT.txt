Music skin tasks:

	
3. MAKE THE METER SHOW THE TIMES
	Find the Meter I made that shows the Times on your skin
	It will have two fields: MeasureName and MeasureName2
	MeasureName is the Measure that says how much time has passed
	MeasureName2 is the Measure that shows the length of the song
	
	
HINTS FOR SETTING THE METER UP
	Do NOT put [brackets] around the measurenames in the meter
	The measures you use here will be the same ones you JUST made
	When you test, it will show SECONDS, not times. 
	I will fix that later
	So instead of 1:00/2:00 it will say 60/120
	I will FIX THIS LATER
